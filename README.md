## Game Rules
### 1st Rule: Start the Game
We have a board 6x6 with 4 treasures and 3 traps.
The first player will choose a cell to place the traps and treasures.
When Player 1 finishes, it has to click 'End Turn' on the left top side to change turn for the Player 2.

### 2nd Rule: Movements
The 2nd Player starts the game with 20 movements. It has to click on a specific cell from the board
to search the treasures hidden by Player 1. For each empty cell clicked the Player uses 1 available movement, 
and for each trap found, 1 movement is lost.

### 3rd Rule: Winning the Game
If all treasures are not found by the Player 2 after all movements, Player 1 wins the game.
If all treasures are found by Player 2, Player 2 wins the game.
